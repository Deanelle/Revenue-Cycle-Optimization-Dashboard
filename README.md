Background 

No mission, no margin. Without focusing on the revenue in healthcare, there is no mission to serve the public and improve health outcomes for the community. In order to make sure there hospital system can serve the people, it must make sure that revenue cycle processes are optimized. 

Business Task: 

For this project, I focused on hospital administrative staff because they are struggling to track key revenue cycle metrics, leading to delays in billing and cash flow issues.

Business Question: 

How can we improve the efficiency of the revenue cycle and identify opportunities to maximize revenue stream?
